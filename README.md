# Building a real-time image classification web app with Python and MLDB.ai

### [Pycon Canada 2016 Tutorial](https://2016.pycon.ca/fr/schedule/071-francois-maillet/)

> In this tutorial, we will build a real-time machine learning web app using Python and MLDB.ai. We will use MLDB's Tensorflow integration to use a deep learning model to embed images in a high dimensional conceptual space, and use that representation as features to do transfer learning. This will allow us to build a real-time image classification endpoint.

## About

This repo contains the built web app. 

For those who attended the talk, the glitch that caused the built plugin to fail to load is now fixed. The code below will work properly.

## Slides & screen cast

The slides are available in the `talk` folder of the repository. Check back for a screen cast of the talk to be posted within 2 weeks.


### Installing the plugin

```python
from pymldb import Connection
mldb = Connection()

mldb.put("/v1/plugins/pycon", {
    "type": "python",
    "params": {
        "address": "git://github.com/mldbai/pyconca-2016.git"
    }
})
```

You can then browse to `https://<host:port>/v1/plugins/pycon/routes/static/index.html` to access the UI.
